'''Find if a number is even or odd using XOR operation'''
#With XOR Operation, if a number is EVEN, after XOR operation with 1, number value will increase by 1
# if the number is odd, after XOR operation with 1, number value will decrease by 1
#XOR operation means, if both are 0 or 1, it will be 0, if either is 1 or 0, it will be 1
